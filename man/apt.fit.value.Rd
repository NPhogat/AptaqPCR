\description{
Function \code{apt.fit.value} combines the data of the fitting results, produced
as an output of the function \code{apt.fit} and uses the data to populate an object of
Class \code{"aptaqpcr"}. The function \code{apt.fit.value} acts as a link between the functions
\code{apt.fit} and \code{mean.conf} as well as between \code{apt.fit} and \code{tempconc.plot}.

\examples{
##To read the .csv file
file1 <- system.file("exData", "multiapt31.csv", package = "AptaqPCR")
read.datacsv <- ReadAptaqPCR(file1)

## To combine the replicates on the basis of the mean
meandata <- mean.apt(read.datacsv)

## To compute the first derivative of the combined replicates
diffdata <- diff.apt(meandata)

## To express the first derivative data
data <- slot(diffdata,"diffData")
temp <- data[,"temp"] ##Temperature data

## To fit the negative of first derivative data to generate the fitting results in the
##form of values (an object of Class data.frame)

nc <- apt.fit(data[,"nc"],44,1,3,53,1,3,"BFGS",2e-9,temp)
b <- apt.fit(data[,"b"],44,1,3,53,1,3,"BFGS",2e-9,temp)
c <- apt.fit(data[,"c"],44,1,3,53,1,3,"BFGS",2e-9,temp)
d <- apt.fit(data[,"d"],44,1,3,53,1,3,"BFGS",2e-9,temp)

h <- apt.fit(data[,"h"],44,1,3,53,1,3,"BFGS",2e-9,temp)

## implement the function apt.fit.value to combine all the results
## default column names
aptfitall <- apt.fit.value(nc,b,c,d,e,f,g,h)

##To express the combined fitting results
slot(aptfitall,"fitData")

## By defining column names (specific)
aptfitalls <- apt.fit.value(nc,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,
conc = c("0 pM", "30.50 pM", "15.25 pM","7.62 pM", "3.81 pM", "1.90 pM",
"0.95 pM","0.47 nM"))

##To express the combined fitting results
